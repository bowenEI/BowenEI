I received the B.E. degree in Computer Science and Technology from Anhui University in 2021. I am currently a student pursuing a Ph.D degree of Computer Science and Technology in Southeast University.

When I was a sophomore in Anhui University, I entered the [Intelligent Software and Edge Computing (ISEC)](http://isec.ahu.edu.cn/main.psp) lab to do scientific research, under the guidance of [Prof. Xuejun Li](http://cs.ahu.edu.cn/2021/0719/c11201a265362/page.htm) and [Prof. Yi Xu](http://cs.ahu.edu.cn/2021/0611/c11201a262009/page.htm). My research interests include Edge Computing and Edge Intelligence. Compared to my peers, I have more profound experience in scientific research. Now my supervisor is [Prof. Fang Dong](https://cse.seu.edu.cn/2019/0102/c23024a256994/page.htm) in Southeast University.
